# Tetris: A Java/Git exercise

## Summary

This repository contains a basic implementation of a Tetris-like game.
It currently lacks many features of the original game, some of which
are described in the issues.

**IMPORTANT**: Currently, the game is entirely automated - there's no
realtime interaction with the user. Instead, the moves are generated
randomly. While you may be tempted to do a research on how to read a single
key from the keyboard, it's not an easy thing in Java (usually involving
native methods), so probably there are better things to do first ;-)

## Task

Your task is to:

1. Pick an issue that doesn't have an implementor yet. An implementor here
   is indicated in a comment, like "I'm working on this task.". 
   * If there's no issue without an implementor, you can pick one of the
     already picked. Just add another comment like above.
1. **Fork the repository** (button in the upper right corner of the main page).
1. **On the fork**, create a feature branch with a name following a convention:
   ```
   issueID-short-but-meaningful-description-written-in-kebab-case
   ```
   For example:
   ```
   999-implement-realtime-interaction
   ```
   (Don't put `#` in the name of the branch)
1. implement the feature **on your fork**,
1. push the changes to a remote feature branch **on your fork**,
1. create a Pull Request to merge it to `EPAM-Online-Courses/tetris:master`.

## Rules

1. Your implementation shall not break any of the existing functionalities.
1. The solution shall be delivered in the form of self-contained commits.
   Each commit contains:
   
   * a consistent, working set of changes,
   * a set of tests that prove the changes actually work,
   * a documentation attached to public API,
   * a commit message reasonably explaining the changes.

1. You shall touch only those classes that are necessary for the purpose
   of resolving the issue. Too wide, especially unrelated changes may cause
   the PR to be rejected.
1. Feel free to add missing tests and Javadocs.
   * It might require creating a proper directory structure for the test classes.
